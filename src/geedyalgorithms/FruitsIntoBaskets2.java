/*
You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n,
where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit,
and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:
    Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with
    a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
    Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
    If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

Input: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]

Output: 1

Explanation:

    fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.
    fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.
    fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.

Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.

Tip - (fruit type not how many fruits : like 5 is unplaced so its 1 type fruit not 5-4 = 1)
